Run scripts for the paper 
   "Crustal conditions favoring convective downward migration of fractures in deep hydrothermal systems" by S Halld贸rsd贸ttir, I Berre, E Keilegavlen and G Axelsson

The scripts are partly based on the scripts for the paper 
   "Numerical modelling of convection-driven cooling, deformation and fracturing of thermo-poroelastic media" by I Stefansson, E Keilegavlen, S Halld贸rsd贸ttir and I Berre, that presented a proof-of-concept for CDM. However, in the present study, we simulate different geological settings known to host hydrothermal systems.

The simulation results may be reproduced using version 1.4.2 of PorePy.
